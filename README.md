## ZS-SSL Overview
ZS-SSL enables physics-guided deep learning MRI reconstruction using only a single slice/sample ([paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=085y6YPaYjP)).
Succintly, ZS-SSL  partitions the available measurements from a single scan into three disjoint sets. Two of these sets are used to enforce data consistency and define loss during training for self-supervision, while the last set serves to self-validate, establishing an early stopping criterion. In the presence of models pre-trained on a database with different image characteristics, ZS-SSL can be combined with transfer learning (TL) for faster convergence time and reduced computational complexity.

*An overview of the proposed zero-shot self-supervised learning approach. a) Acquired
measurements for the single scan are partitioned into three sets: a training (Θ) and loss mask (Λ) for
self-supervision, and a self-validation mask for automated early stopping (Γ). b) The parameters,
θ, of the unrolled MRI reconstruction network are updated using Θ and Λ in the data consistency
(DC) units of the unrolled network and for defining loss, respectively. c) Concurrently, a k-space
validation procedure is used to establish the stopping criterion by using Ω\Γ in the DC units and Γ
to measure a validation loss. d) Once the network training has been stopped due to an increasing
trend in the k-space validation loss, the final reconstruction is performed using the relevant learned
network parameters and all the acquired measurements in the DC unit.*


## Installation
Dependencies are given in environment.yml. A new conda environment `zs_ssl` can be installed with
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
## Datasets
We have used the [fastMRI](https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/) dataset in our experiments.

## How to use
ZS-SSL training can be performed by running `zs_ssl_train.py` file. Prior to running training file, hyperparameters such as number of unrolled blocks, split ratio for validation,training and loss masks can be adjusted from `parser_ops.py`.

`zs_ssl_train.py`  file saves the model corresponding to lowest validation error and saves it to the directory defined by user. Testing can be performed by running `zs_ssl_test.ipynb` file. 

We highly recommend the users to set the outer k-space regions with no signal as 1 in training mask to ensure consistency with acquired measurements. This should be done for both `zs_ssl_train.py` and `zs_ssl_test.ipynb` files. Please refer to our [SSDU](https://github.com/byaman14/SSDU) repository for further details.

#### Transfer Learning (TL)
If ZS-SSL will be combined with TL, user should enable TL option and provide TL path to `parser_ops.py`. Note that, for transfer learning, pretrained model and ZS-SSL should have the same network architecture. We have provided a pretrained supervised model compatible with ZS-SSL architecture in `pretrained_models` folder. The pretrained model is used in `zs_ssl_train.py` for initializing the weights for the training.  Pretrained self-supervised models can also be used with ZS-SSL.   

#### Early Automated Stopping
In `parser_ops.py`, we have also defined a parameter (`--stop_training`) to automatically stop the training process. The `--stop_training` parameter denotes the number of consecutive epochs without achieving a lower validation loss (to disable early automated stopping, fix `--stop_training` to  the number of epochs).
